		<p>Kennedy’s Accomplishments as President
In terms of administering foreign relations, Kennedy also made remarkable contributions in addressing the issues surrounding America’s relation with other countries. His ideological view on 
a world of diversity received high praises in the third world. His diplomatic approach to other nations drew the attention of many people. He was adored for it, as it was not often seen in his
 predecessors. One of the priorities of the Kennedy administration was to settle disputes among foreign lands by resolving issues of war and bringing peace. He was very considerate in 
 strengthening foreign policies, more so than with domestic policies. Kennedy also addressed the problem of miscalculation as a source of conflicts against other nations, especially the Soviet
  Union. He worked hard on developing foreign policy without depending on another person. In fact, Kennedy did not appoint a secretary of state. He performed all the duties by himself to make sure
   everything he intended to do would not be influenced. He also succeeded in creating the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 which aimed to overhaul the American immigration policy.
    This program was created as an extension of civil rights policies and to abolish discrimination in approving immigration based on country of origin.</p>

		<h2>Political Life</h2>
		<p>Political Life
As the Kennedy’s political legacy was about to be passed to its successor and John’s older brother, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., the latter was killed in a military operation. The death of his brother
 led John to pursue career in politics despite the injuries he suffered during the war and all other illnesses that troubled him since childhood. His family was in full support and expected him
  to succeed in the political race. They gathered supporters from the military and colleagues. They also conducted several social events to raise money for his campaigns. In 1946, he ran for the 
  position of the U.S House of Representatives from the Massachusetts’ eleventh Congressional district as part of the Democratic Party and eventually won the race by a large margin against his 
  Republican opponent.</p>
